                            <p>Dear 18 year old Ananya,
                                <br> I know you think life isn't as great. You were just about getting the hang of college life when your first boyfriend dumped you. You were in a serious relationship, or so you thought, and you were completely smitten by him.</p>
                            <p>I know, girl, you are lying face down in your pillow, second-guessing your decision to put down the 5th unsolicited dating proposal you received this year. So many of your friends are dating, and while you love your single life, you find yourself often feeling alone or left out during group hangouts.</p>
                            <p>But, don't be so harsh on yourself - you took the right decision. You shouldn't settle for someone you don't even like just for the sake of getting into the 'dating wagon.' I know it's easy to start worrying that your friends might stop hanging out with you, or that you may never be able to find a guy of your choice, that you will have to settle with men who go hot and cold, while every other friend around you is finding their 'happy ending.' I know it hurts a little bit to go for your favorite movie alone or not have anyone with whom to discuss a random topic to death because your friends are suddenly ‘too busy’ for you and new ones are almost impossible to find.</p>
                            <p>Let me tell you a secret. Remember how mom always said, don’t talk to strangers on the internet. Well, you will go ahead and create an anonymous blog and orkut profile anyway. It will be your only comfort at a time when your MS preparations will be driving you crazy. You would take breaks from studies and chat with your friends online about the most varied list of topics. And one day there you would find this great guy you would date for two happy years.</p>
                            <p>It will be after him that you will lose your inhibitions of finding good people online. I know 2000s are the time when everybody is scared of technology, mostly because it is so new and unknown, but you will realise in a few years that fear is overrated.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="body-text">
                            <p>You will "meet up" exciting people on Gchat, invite the romantic interest you met on Facebook to hang out with your chums. You might be scandalised to know this, but trust me, just a late-night WhatsApp chat or tweet for an impromptu date will actually give you an adrenaline rush - something that you are skeptical of right now.</p>
